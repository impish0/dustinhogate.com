# Why You Can’t Control Outcomes—But You Can Influence Them
A few weeks ago, I shared a cycle that’s worth remembering:
- You cannot control outcomes.
- You cannot control other people.
- When it’s your turn to make a decision, you have to make a decision. Get it wrong if you must, but make a decision.
This idea isn’t new, and it isn’t complicated. The problem is, when it actually matters, people tend to forget it.

## **Why This is a Cycle**

Let me walk you through a real example from my business that reinforced this lesson.

### **The Marketing Problem**

At my company, our e-commerce branch had grown from zero to over one million in revenue with no marketing budget.

But to reach two million, it became clear we needed marketing help.

I did my research, spoke to other business owners, and chose a marketing company that seemed like a great fit.

This company was supposed to be my counterpart—the missing piece that would help scale my business in ways my team and I couldn’t on our own.

### **Understanding Counterparts in Decision-Making**

Whenever you work with another person or company, you become their counterpart, and they become yours.

Your counterpart has the ability to influence the outcome you want—just as you do.

My goal was to improve our marketing strategy and increase sales. Their goal was to grow their business by keeping me as a client.

In theory, this should have been a perfect partnership. They provide results, I continue paying for their services.

But that’s not what happened.

### **When Outcomes Don’t Align**

It quickly became clear that this marketing company did not align with my vision, delivered poor results, and wasted my time and resources.

At this moment, I had a decision to make:
1. Stick with them and hope things improve.

2. Cut my losses and find a new marketing company.

I chose to leave.

That decision—taking action instead of waiting—changed the outcome for both of us.
- For me, it saved my company from wasting more time and money.
- For them, it freed them up to find better-fit clients.
If I had stayed, I would have continued paying for bad service, stunted my company’s growth, and let another company determine my outcome for me.

This is why making decisions matters.

## **The Real Cost of Indecision**

If you refuse to make a decision, you relinquish control of your own outcomes, allow others to dictate your results, and create frustration for both yourself and your counterparts.

If I had stayed with that marketing company, we both would have suffered. I’d be stuck with a bad service. They’d be stuck with a frustrated client.

By actively making a decision, I kept control over my own outcome.

## **The Takeaway: How to Influence Outcomes in Business**

You cannot control every outcome, but you can control how you respond.

Here are three key lessons to remember:
- **You cannot control outcomes, but you can control your influence.** If something isn’t working, change your approach. Engage in shaping your results instead of waiting for things to change.
- **You cannot control other people, but you can influence the process.** Your counterpart has their own goals—make sure they align with yours. If they don’t, move on.
- **When it’s your turn to make a decision, make it.** Even if you get it wrong, making a decision is better than making none. Indecision stalls progress for everyone involved.

## **Final Thoughts: Own Your Decisions**

Outcomes don’t just happen. They are shaped by the choices we make.

Next time you’re faced with a tough decision, ask yourself:
- Am I making the decision that best influences the outcome I want?
- Or am I letting someone else decide for me?
Because in the end, the only thing worse than making the wrong decision is refusing to make one at all.
