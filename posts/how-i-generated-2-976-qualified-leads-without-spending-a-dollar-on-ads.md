# How I Generated 2,976 Qualified Leads With Zero Ad Spend

## **The Simple Shift That Changed Everything**

Today, I’m going to tell you how I built a system that gathered **2,976 qualified leads** with **zero dollars in ad spend**—and ultimately generated millions in revenue.

The concept was simple: Instead of the typical sales strategy of “*Call us with your questions*” (which sounds like a customer service nightmare), I shifted to *“Schedule a Build Call”*.

It changed the game.

**Every single slot on my calendar was full of qualified leads, and I never spent a dime on advertising.**
Why?
**Because this approach**:
- Put the power in the hands of future customers
- Framed the conversation as a partnership, not a pushy sales pitch
- Made it easy for people to get help while setting the right expectations
This week, I’ll walk you through exactly how I built this system.

Next week, I’ll show you how I drove people to it.

## **The System Overview**

**Here’s the simple four-step process**:
1. Set up an online form that qualified the leads
2. Redirect the form submission to a scheduling page
3. Call the lead at the scheduled time (30-minute call)
4. Send a post-call parts list and invoice
Now, let’s break down how it worked.

## **Step 1: Building a Form That Qualifies Leads**

I used [123FormBuilder.com](https://www.123formbuilder.com/) to create a lead qualification form.

The form had three key sections:
1. **Introduction:** Described the purpose of the call and set expectations.

2. **Pre-Made Drop-Downs:** Helped speed up calls while ensuring the lead was informed and relevant.

3. **Open-Ended Questions:** Allowed the lead to describe their goals in their own words.

### **Section 1: Setting the Stage**

This was a short summary (100-200 words) designed to do two things:
- Confirm the lead’s problem and validate their frustration.
- Explain what would happen on the call and how it would help them.
Here’s an example:
> “Are you tired of doing hours of research only to find conflicting answers?
>
> If you're wondering, *How do I know which [XYZ] thing works for MY [XYZ] goals?*, this is the call for you.
>
> On this call, we’ll go over your exact setup, your goals, and the best plan for you.
>
> Fill out the questions below, click **“Schedule Call”**, and pick a time on my calendar. Talk soon!”

### **Section 2: Filtering Out Unqualified Leads**

This section contained 5-6 multiple-choice drop-down questions to make sure:
- The lead had a truck we actually worked on
- We gathered important details before the call
**Example Questions:**
- What year is your truck? (Dropdown: Only supported years listed)
- What transmission does it have? (Dropdown: All supported options)
- What turbo does it have now?(Stock or list popular modified options)
- What size tires does it have? (Dropdown: Tire size ranges)

### **Section 3: Understanding the Lead’s Goals**

This section had 2-3 open-ended questions so the lead could explain their situation.

**Example Questions:**
- Describe your current [XYZ] setup: *(Text field)*
- What’s your goal for this project? *(Text field)*
At the bottom of the form was a big, clear button that said “*Schedule Call*”.

Clicking it submitted the form (which sent me an email) and redirected the lead to my calendar.

💡 **Pro Tip:**
I configured the form so that the lead’s name appeared in the subject line of the email notification. That way, when it was time for the call, I could quickly search my inbox for their name and pull up their form.

## **Step 2: Setting Up the Calendar**

For scheduling, I used Calendly.

Why?
- It made it easy to create a public calendar
- I could modify availability anytime without adjusting the form
- It automatically sent confirmation and reminder emails
On the calendar booking page, I only asked for:
- **Name**
- **Phone number**
- **Email**
Calendly sent the lead a confirmation email and a reminder on the morning of our call.

## **Step 3: Calling the Lead**

At the scheduled time, I called the lead with their form in front of me so I was fully prepared.

Every call started like this:
> **“Hey [Name]! This is Dusty with 1023 Diesel. You filled out a build plan and scheduled this time to talk about your truck. Is now a bad time to talk?”**
**This specific script worked because**:
- It reminded them why I was calling
- It positioned me as a trusted expert they reached out to.
- It quickly launched us into the real conversation.
Keeping calls on track is a learned skill. But after enough reps, I could gather everything I needed in under 30 minutes.

## **Step 4: Sending the Post-Call Email**

After the call, I sent a follow-up email by replying to the form submission notification.

**This email included**:
- A summary of what we discussed
- A list of recommended parts (formatted as an invoice)
- A clear call to action (so they knew the next steps)

## **Why This Worked So Well**

1. It attracted serious buyers.
- Only qualified leads made it through the process.
- They were already invested in the conversation before we spoke.
2. It removed all sales pressure.
- People didn’t feel “sold to.”
- Instead, they felt helped—which made buying easy.
3. It filled my calendar without spending a dime.
- Every slot was booked with highly engaged leads.
