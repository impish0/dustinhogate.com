34 Newsletters.

40,000 words.

200+ Hours.

Those are the (approximate) numbers for the LTL Newsletter over the last 7-months.

That's like half a stinking novel!

I'm pretty proud of that, because I knew this process was going to be HARD, and I did it anyway.

But, I said at the very beginning (issue #2 I believe) - I am doing this, so I can learn to communicate clearly AND to learn which thoughts are worth keeping.

I suspected that writing, which I previously avoided at all cost, would be the key to filtering thought, and that was 100% correct.

The problem is, I spent my entire adult life telling myself I was not cut out for this.

I'm dyslexic, and people like that don't write.

I can't spell.

I can't focus while sitting down.

Blank paper gives me anxiety.

There were a lot of reason to not do this, but I also knew every one of them would only be true if I thought it was true.

If you want to be something you are not, the only way to change is to start acting like the person you want to be.

Inevitably, if you live it, you will become it, but it's a choice that you have to make.

Let this be my encouragement to you.

The only way to move forward with who you want to be, is to be it.

And the only thing stopping you is you.

The good news is that means you, and only you have the power change it.
