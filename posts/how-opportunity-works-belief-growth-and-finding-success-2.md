This sounds great. It might even get you a lot of likes on Facebook.

But let’s test it out.

Think about a real problem you’re facing right now. Now say out loud, “If I had a solution, my problem would be gone!”
Did your problem disappear?
If so, you can stop reading. But if, like me, you need more than motivational quotes to solve real problems, keep going.

This is how I break problems down so they can actually be solved.

## The Problem-Solving Cycle

Before we get into the three types of problems, here’s something to remember:
- You cannot control outcomes.
- You cannot control other people.
- When it’s your turn to make a decision, you have to make one. Even if you’re wrong, make a decision.

## The Three Types of Problems

Every problem falls into one of these categories:
1. **Lack of Resources** – You don’t have the tools, knowledge, or experience you need.

2. **Lack of Picture** – You do have the tools, knowledge, and experience, but don’t know how to use them.

3. **Lack of Accountability** – You have the resources and know how to use them, but you choose not to.

Understanding which type of problem you’re dealing with makes all the difference in how you solve it.

## 1) Lack of Resources

Being able to solve problems—even if you get it wrong—helps you become better at solving future problems.

### Step 1: Label Your Position

When you hit a roadblock, ask yourself, “Do I know what tools, talent, or software I need?”
If the answer is no, you’re lacking resources. This is actually a good thing.

The only thing worse than not having the right resources is thinking you have them when you actually don’t.

### An Example From My Business

When I started my second company, I knew we needed an online store to reach more customers. But I had never run an e-commerce store before, so I had no idea what features we’d need.

I did some research, made my best guess, and picked a platform.

It turned out to be a disaster.
- The SEO was bad.
- The navigation was bad.
- The product pages were bad.
- The store management was bad.
- And it was ugly.
But we got customers.

By choosing the wrong platform, I learned exactly what we needed in the future. I gained the tools, knowledge, and experience that I didn’t have before I made the wrong choice.

### Takeaway

When you get it wrong, don’t just move on—learn from it.

Write down three to five reasons why your decision didn’t work. Acknowledge it. Move forward.

If you do this, you’ll improve faster than you can imagine.

## 2) Lack of Picture

Sometimes, the problem isn’t resources—it’s **perspective**.

### Story Time

For six years, while I was building our e-commerce branch, we had a recurring problem with shipping costs.
- At first, we didn’t realize it was a problem.
- Then, we noticed it but ignored it.
- Later, we acknowledged it but couldn’t solve it.
- By year six, we finally took it seriously.
We tried everything. We changed platforms, tested different software, and even considered building our own system.

Then, in an executive meeting, my business partner who wasn’t involved in e-commerce asked a simple question:
“Why can’t you just estimate the total shipping cost by month or quarter, divide that by the products shipped, and charge that number?”
I got irritated. I argued all the reasons this wouldn’t work.

Then, I realized he was right. We didn’t have to calculate every single product perfectly.

Within two days, we were testing a new system. Within a week, it was up and running.

### Takeaway

When a problem seems too complex, there’s a good chance you’re too close to it.

If you’re a leader, you need **peers** who can see things from a different perspective and who want you to succeed.

## 3) Lack of Accountability

I recently heard Jordan Peterson say something like, “People fear two things the most: painful death and public humiliation. The only thing scarier would be a painful death in a very humiliating way.”
It made me think about accountability.

Admitting when you’re clueless is tough. But it’s even harder when you **know what to do and still don’t do it**.

### When Success Led to Complacency

Early in my business, I was working hard day and night. But as things got more stable, I got comfortable.

We upgraded to a bigger shop but didn’t have enough office space for our online support team. No problem—I turned a guest house I owned into an office.

It seemed like a perfect setup. No commute, more time with family.

But it also led to laziness. I started sleeping in. I missed meetings. I ignored time zones for our customers and vendors.

I knew it wasn’t OK. My team trusted me to show up, and I was letting them down.

So, I hired a business coach.

His job was simple: keep me accountable to my values and potential.

### Takeaway

You have to want accountability. If you don’t want to change, no one can make you.
- The person keeping you accountable has to tell you the truth, even if it’s uncomfortable.
- They should be someone you respect enough to care about what they say.

## Final Thoughts

If you’re stuck, your problem falls into one of these categories:
1. Lack of Resources – You need tools, knowledge, or experience.

2. Lack of Picture – You have the tools, but you’re missing perspective.

3. Lack of Accountability – You know what to do but aren’t doing it.

Once you understand which one you’re dealing with, the path to solving it becomes much clearer.

So, what problem are you facing right now? And more importantly, which type is it?
