## How Passion Built My First 1,000 Customers

There are two kinds of things people buy:
1. Things that areÂ **good**Â and worth buying
2. Things that areÂ **terrible**Â and not worth buying
Sounds simple, but there areÂ **so many**Â things available right now that just arenâ€™t worth buying.

### **Building Something Worth Having**

Two years before I started a companyâ€”before I knew anything about e-commerceâ€”I was building a tool that solvedÂ **my own problem**.

For context: I builtÂ **software that makes old, slow trucks go faster and run smoother**.

This wasnâ€™t a business idea. I just wanted my own truck to run better. But every solution I bought createdÂ **more**Â problems. So, I built my own.

And because I get excited and never shut up about things Iâ€™m passionate aboutâ€¦ I talked about it. A lot.

### **How My First Customers Found Me**

In the firstÂ **12â€“18 months**Â of learning how to build this software, my constant enthusiasm attractedÂ **people who had the same problem**.

A few of them were crazy enough to let me test my ideas on their trucks.

Put simply, IÂ **unintentionally built something other people wanted**Â by focusing on making somethingÂ **I**Â wanted.

ðŸ‘‰Â **Ingredient #1:**Â I spentÂ **years**Â building something worth havingÂ *before*Â I tried to sell it.

## **Enthusiasm Sells**

Like I said, I couldnâ€™t stop talking about what I was building.

That enthusiasm didnâ€™t justÂ **attract** the right people it **repelled**Â the wrong ones.

But the people whoÂ liked my kind of weird? - They wanted to be part of it.

### **Passion Attracts Customers (and Talent)**

Hereâ€™s an example:
When we shipped packages, weâ€™d take a selfie at the store and send it to the customer to let them know their order was on the way.

It was a small, unnecessary thing. But itÂ made people feel like they were part of something real.

This kind of care, enthusiasm, and weirdnessÂ **makes people want to support you**.

It even attracted employees that way. People who werenâ€™t just looking for a paycheck but wanted to be part of what we were building.

ðŸ‘‰Â **Ingredient #2:****We shared a wild passion for what we did, and it made people want to be part of it.**

## **The Simple Lesson for Today**

1. Build somethingÂ **you**Â actually want.

2. Talk about it with enthusiasm.

3. Let people see your passion.

People donâ€™t just buyÂ **products**. They buyÂ **enthusiasm, confidence, and energy**.

And that? Thatâ€™s something worth buying.
