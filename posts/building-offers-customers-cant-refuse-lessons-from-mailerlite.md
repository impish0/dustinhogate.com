## **Hypothetical You**

Let’s pretend you just started a small company and need a way to manage and email your customers.

You do a Google search and find [MailerLite](https://www.mailerlite.com/a/SKwt5a9VWjHJ).

You click the link, check out their pricing page, and see this:

At first glance, it does what you need—**it sends emails**.

But then you notice it does a lot more than that.
- Transaction emails
- Campaign emails
- A/B split testing
- Automation
- Pre-made templates
And, if that wasn’t enough, it’s also a website builder, landing page creator, blog, and more, **all for less than $10 a month**.

This isn’t just solving one problem. It’s giving you tools you didn’t even know you needed yet.

That’s an *irresistible offer*.

## **The Power of a Good Offer**

In fact, I was so impressed with MailerLite that I chose it for my own website and newsletter.

Remember when you subscribed? That was on a site **built with MailerLite**, and every email you've received from me has been sent using the same platform.

So why am I telling you this?
Because we’re about to **reverse engineer** what makes an offer so good people would be stupid to say no.

## **Reverse Engineering a Winning Offer**

Take another look at MailerLite’s pricing page:

The obvious purpose of this list? To separate the different tiers.

The non-obvious purpose? To show how many valuable features come with each plan, tailored specifically to what their target customer (you) is looking for.

**Think about it**:
- You came looking for a simple way to send emails.
- You found something cheaper than expected.
- And it offered way more than you hoped for.
That’s how a ***great offer*** works.

## **What This Means for You**

The best way to get new clients is to create an offer so good people would be stupid to say no.

How do you do that?
By listening to your customers.

## **What We Learned from MailerLite**


### **Lesson #1: Listen to Your Customers**

Understanding your *ideal* customer means understanding:
- **Their biggest pain points**
- **What they actually need**
- **What frustrates them about current options**
If you’re on the front lines handling sales, you’ll hear exactly what your customers want—and what they don’t want.

Rather than getting frustrated with complaints, use them. Complaints tell you what’s missing in the market.

There are two ways this plays out:

### **Possibility #1: You Adjust Your Offer**

You listen to their complaints and **add what’s missing**.

For example, if customers struggle with using your product, you add **education** to the post-sale process.

📌 **Result:** Customers get what they actually need, and you get happier, more loyal customers.

### **Possibility #2: You Realize You’re Selling to the Wrong People**

Sometimes complaints aren’t about missing features, they’re about misalignment.

If your customers keep asking for things your product doesn’t do (and shouldn’t do), you’re probably targeting the wrong audience.

📌 **Result:** You refine your marketing to attract better-fit customers.

Either way, **feedback is gold. I**t helps you build a **better** product *and* a **better** business.

## **How MailerLite Used This to Build an Irresistible Offer**

MailerLite started as a web design company.

While helping small businesses with website design, they noticed a **gap** in the market—there weren’t great email marketing tools for their customers.

So, they built one.

Then, by listening to customer pain points, they kept improving it:
- People struggled with building websites → **They added a website builder**.
- People needed landing pages → **They added a landing page builder**.
- People needed better automation → **They made it easy to use**.
**Side note:** They didn’t build everything from scratch. They used the skills they already had to create an offer people *wanted* to buy.

## **The Takeaway: Build an Offer That Sells Itself**

A great offer isn’t about tricking people into buying. It’s about giving them what they actually want.

### **How to Make Your Offer Irresistible**

1️⃣ **Solve a real problem** (even better if it’s one you’ve experienced yourself).

2️⃣ **Listen to your customers**—their complaints tell you what’s missing.

3️⃣ **Make your offer so good it feels like a no-brainer.**
That’s how you create something people can’t ignore.
