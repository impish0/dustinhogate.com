# The 5 Reasons People Don't Do What You Want Them Too
I love this framework.

I first learned it from **Alex Hormozi** in the context of leading and managing people, and it’s become an integral part of how I work with others.

I’m sharing it exactly how I heard it, because it stuck with me, and I hope it does the same for you.

All thanks and credit to Mr. Hormozi for this one.

## Why People Don’t Follow Through

If you’ve ever asked someone to do something—whether an employee, a contractor, or a business partner—and they didn’t follow through, you probably felt frustrated.

But the real question is: why didn’t they do it?
This framework breaks it down into five reasons—and how to fix each one.

## 1. They Don’t KNOW You Want Them to Do It


### The Fix: Communicate Clearly

If you never clearly tell someone what you need, how can you expect them to do it?
It sounds obvious, but you’d be surprised how many leadership failures boil down to a lack of communication.
- Be specific about what you want
- Don’t assume people will “just know”
- If something is important, say it outright
If they know what needs to be done and they still don’t do it, the next problem is:

## 2. They Don’t Know HOW to Do It


### The Fix: Train Them Properly

If someone doesn’t have the knowledge or skills to do the job, no amount of motivation will fix it.
- Provide training, SOPs, videos, or live demos
- Invest in one-on-one coaching or external courses
- Don’t expect people to “figure it out” if they’ve never done it before
Now, if they know what to do and how to do it, but still don’t do it the next issue is:

## 3. They Don’t Know WHEN You Need It Done


### The Fix: Set Clear Deadlines

Even if someone understands the task, if there’s no deadline, it won’t get done on time.
- Give them a specific due date
- If it’s urgent, communicate that clearly
- Follow up at key milestones to ensure progress
If they know what to do, how to do it, and when it needs to be done, but still don’t follow through, the next issue is:

## 4. They Don’t WANT to Do It


### The Fix: Find What Motivates Them

This is where leadership, not just management, comes in.

People need a reason to care about their work. If they don’t, they’ll avoid doing it—or do it poorly.
- Understand what drives them (money, growth, recognition, etc.)
- Tie the task to their personal goals or company vision
- If they’re not the right fit, it may be time to reassess their role
If they know what to do, how to do it, when to do it, and they want to do it—but it’s still not happening, the final issue is:

## 5. They CAN’T Do It (Something Is Blocking Them)


### The Fix: Identify & Remove Barriers

Sometimes, it’s not a motivation issue—it’s a logistical one.

Even with all the right training, deadlines, and motivation, if something is blocking them, they literally can’t do the job.
- Do they have the right tools or resources?
- Is something in the system slowing them down?
- Is another person holding up the process?
Imagine asking a world-class barber to cut your hair—without clippers, scissors, or even a knife.

All the skill, training, and motivation in the world don’t matter if they don’t have the right tools.

## Why This Framework Works

The obvious benefit of this framework is that it helps you solve execution problems efficiently—instead of wasting time getting frustrated with people.

But the bigger benefit is that it helps you lead without attacking people personally.
- It’s easy to say, “You’re just bad at your job.”
- It’s smarter to say, “What’s stopping this from getting done?”
Motivating someone isn’t about criticizing them. It’s about removing the obstacles that prevent execution.

## Fix the Problem, Not the Person

Next time you’re frustrated that something isn’t getting done, ask yourself:
1. Do they know I need them to do this?
2. Do they know how to do it?
3. Do they know when it needs to be done?
4. Are they motivated to do it?
5. Is something blocking them?
If you work through these five questions, you’ll solve almost every execution problem in your business without creating unnecessary conflict.

This is what leadership actually looks like.

Try it out. You’ll be surprised at how often the real issue isn’t the person, it’s the process.
