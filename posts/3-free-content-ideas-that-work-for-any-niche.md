## The YouTube Methods

### Why YouTube Works

I had the best luck with YouTube. Probably because of the demographic (25-40-year-old males). If you‚Äôre starting now, I‚Äôd recommend TikTok for short videos and YouTube for longer videos.

When I left 1023 Diesel, our YouTube channel had 450K views and 5K subscribers. That might not seem like much, but content marketing isn‚Äôt about going viral, it's about attracting your ideal client - the one you can solve a problem for.

That requires being hyper "niche" and specific on what you say and how you say it.

YouTube is excellent for discoverability, if your content solves a problem, they put it in front of eyeballs that will watch it. Even if you do a ‚ÄúC-minus‚Äù job on the content, as long as it genuinely helps a specific group of people, YouTube will show it to them.

It‚Äôs **hard** to create videos millions of people want to watch.¬†It‚Äôs easy to create videos that a few hundred or a few thousand of your exact, ideal clients will watch.

That‚Äôs where the power of content marketing comes in.

## Formula #1: Q&A With Your Customers‚Äô Questions

Q&A videos work because they directly address real questions from your customers.

These questions can come from:
- Contact forms
- Direct messages
- Facebook pages
- TikTok comments
This format gets a lot of engagement from your ideal clients.

Take a look at this:
![Ep. 2 | Answering YOUR 7.3 Powerstroke Questions  ](3-free-content-ideas-that-work-for-any-niche-2.png)
That video alone got 3,500 views on YouTube purely from answering customer questions.

### How to Make Q&A Videos That Drive Engagement

1. Collect screenshots of real customer questions.

2. Display them on the screen while reading and answering them.

3. Show social proof‚Äîwhen people see others trust you enough to ask questions, they feel more confident reaching out.

At the top of the video description, include a contact page link where viewers can submit questions. Then, mention it at least three times during the video‚Äîbeginning, middle, and end.

**This creates a cycle**:
More questions ‚Üí More videos ‚Üí More views ‚Üí More traffic ‚Üí More sales.

üí° **Q&A Tip:**
If you can have someone read the questions to you while you answer them, it boosts perceived credibility and engagement.

To drive the point home...

## Formula #2 ‚Äì Show How to Buy

Some of the highest-performing videos‚Äîthe ones that drove a huge number of sales‚Äîwere simple "How to Buy" videos.

I know it sounds ridiculous, but these basic videos brought in tens of thousands of views and hundreds of thousands in revenue.

**Take a look at this**:
![300-400HP OBS Powerstroke (How to choose parts for your OBS Build) PT #1](3-free-content-ideas-that-work-for-any-niche-3.png)
These were terrible videos. But they worked.

### How "How to Buy" Videos Generate Sales

- I showed people how to shop for compatible parts.
- I explained my thought process while choosing products.
- I walked viewers through the store like an expert guiding them in person.
This strategy works for any e-commerce business. People trust you more when they see your face and know what to expect.

### How to Make a "How to Buy" Video

- Point a camera at yourself.
- Record your screen with OBS Software.
- Talk through the buying process as if guiding a customer.
This is the easiest content marketing you‚Äôll ever do, and it pays off.

## The Strategy That Got 180K Podcast Downloads for My Business

In 2018, I needed attention but had no budget. So, I started a business podcast named after my brand.

It was essentially an audio version of my YouTube content, but more laid-back, just how I talk.

We also uploaded the podcast to YouTube, usually as audio over an image, not even a real "video."
In 5 years, I only recorded 69 episodes, *that's*¬†*roughly 1 per month*...

**Even with that pace, the results were shocking**:
‚û°Ô∏è 60,000 downloads on podcast apps (as of Feb 2024)
